## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn`

to install all dependencies

### `yarn start`

this will start an express app on localhost:8000

## Important Information

- The backend is deployed on Heroku which in the free tier does not work as expected with cron jobs. I request you to please run the project locally and test the cron job along with other API end-points.
